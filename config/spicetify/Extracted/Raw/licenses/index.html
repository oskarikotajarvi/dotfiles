		<h1>Third-party licenses</h1>
		<p>
			Several fantastic pieces of <a href = "http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> and
			<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open-source</a> software have really helped get
			Spotify to where it is today. A few require that we include their
			license agreements within our product. Consider it done. As we enjoy giving credit where it's due, we included
			the entire list below. This means you can not only see which software we've been using, but the terms of the
			licenses too. A big thanks from all of us at Spotify to the smart people behind the fantastic programs listed. Rock on!
		</p>
		<p>
			Certain FOSS Licenses, such as the GNU General Public License, GNU Lesser (or Library) General Public License, and Mozilla Public License, require that Spotify make available to recipients the source code corresponding to FOSS binaries distributed under those licenses.

<p class="license">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION</p>

<p class="license">   1. Definitions.</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;License&#34; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,<br />
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;Licensor&#34; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by<br />
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;Legal Entity&#34; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all<br />
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common<br />
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,<br />
      &#34;control&#34; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the<br />
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br />
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br />
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;You&#34; (or &#34;Your&#34;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity<br />
      exercising permissions granted by this License.</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;Source&#34; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,<br />
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation<br />
      source, and configuration files.</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;Object&#34; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br />
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br />
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br />
      and conversions to other media types.</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;Work&#34; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br />
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br />
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br />
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;Derivative Works&#34; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br />
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br />
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br />
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br />
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br />
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br />
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;Contribution&#34; shall mean any work of authorship, including<br />
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br />
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br />
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br />
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br />
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#34;submitted&#34;<br />
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br />
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br />
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br />
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br />
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br />
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br />
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#34;Not a Contribution.&#34;</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;Contributor&#34; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br />
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br />
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>

<p class="license">   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br />
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br />
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>

<p class="license">   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br />
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br />
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br />
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br />
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br />
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br />
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br />
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br />
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br />
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br />
      as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

<p class="license">   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br />
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br />
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br />
      meet the following conditions:</p>

<p class="license">      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br />
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>

<p class="license">      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br />
          stating that You changed the files; and</p>

<p class="license">      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br />
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br />
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br />
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br />
          the Derivative Works; and</p>

<p class="license">      (d) If the Work includes a &#34;NOTICE&#34; text file as part of its<br />
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br />
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br />
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br />
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br />
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br />
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br />
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br />
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br />
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br />
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br />
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br />
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br />
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br />
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br />
          as modifying the License.</p>

<p class="license">      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br />
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br />
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br />
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br />
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br />
      the conditions stated in this License.</p>

<p class="license">   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br />
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br />
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br />
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br />
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br />
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br />
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>

<p class="license">   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br />
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br />
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br />
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

<p class="license">   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br />
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br />
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#34;AS IS&#34; BASIS,<br />
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br />
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br />
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br />
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br />
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>

<p class="license">   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br />
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br />
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br />
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br />
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br />
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br />
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br />
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br />
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br />
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<p class="license">   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br />
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br />
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br />
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br />
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br />
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br />
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br />
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br />
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br />
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

<p class="license">   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<p class="license">   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</p>

<p class="license">If you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or<br />
more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly<br />
the order listed) before diving into the code.</p>

<p class="license">OVERVIEW<br />
========</p>

<p class="license">This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,<br />
and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced &#34;jay-peg&#34;) is a standardized compression<br />
method for full-color and grayscale images.</p>

<p class="license">This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive<br />
compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these<br />
processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren&#39;t implemented yet.<br />
We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless<br />
processes defined in the standard.</p>

<p class="license">We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,<br />
plus two sample applications &#34;cjpeg&#34; and &#34;djpeg&#34;, which use the library to<br />
perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.<br />
The library is intended to be reused in other applications.</p>

<p class="license">In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included<br />
considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;<br />
for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG<br />
decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or<br />
colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the<br />
library if not required for a particular application.</p>

<p class="license">We have also included &#34;jpegtran&#34;, a utility for lossless transcoding between<br />
different JPEG processes, and &#34;rdjpgcom&#34; and &#34;wrjpgcom&#34;, two simple<br />
applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.</p>

<p class="license">The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and<br />
flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,<br />
the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the<br />
REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to<br />
be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have<br />
achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.</p>

<p class="license">We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.<br />
No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product<br />
documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.</p>

<p class="license">LEGAL ISSUES<br />
============</p>

<p class="license">In plain English:</p>

<p class="license">1. We don&#39;t promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,<br />
   please let us know!)<br />
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don&#39;t have to pay us.<br />
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a<br />
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that<br />
   you&#39;ve used the IJG code.</p>

<p class="license">In legalese:</p>

<p class="license">The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,<br />
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or<br />
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided &#34;AS IS&#34;, and you,<br />
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.</p>

<p class="license">This software is copyright (C) 1991-2016, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.<br />
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.</p>

<p class="license">Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this<br />
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these<br />
conditions:<br />
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this<br />
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice<br />
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files<br />
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.<br />
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying<br />
documentation must state that &#34;this software is based in part on the work of<br />
the Independent JPEG Group&#34;.<br />
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts<br />
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept<br />
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.</p>

<p class="license">These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,<br />
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to<br />
acknowledge us.</p>

<p class="license">Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author&#39;s name or company name<br />
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from<br />
it.  This software may be referred to only as &#34;the Independent JPEG Group&#39;s<br />
software&#34;.</p>

<p class="license">We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of<br />
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are<br />
assumed by the product vendor.</p>

<p class="license">The Unix configuration script &#34;configure&#34; was produced with GNU Autoconf.<br />
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.<br />
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,<br />
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium<br />
but is also freely distributable.</p>

<p class="license">The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.<br />
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading<br />
support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified<br />
to produce &#34;uncompressed GIFs&#34;.  This technique does not use the LZW<br />
algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable<br />
by all standard GIF decoders.</p>

<p class="license">REFERENCES<br />
==========</p>

<p class="license">We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to<br />
understand the innards of the JPEG software.</p>

<p class="license">The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is<br />
	Wallace, Gregory K.  &#34;The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard&#34;,<br />
	Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.<br />
(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,<br />
applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don&#39;t have the CACM issue<br />
handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace&#39;s article is<br />
available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually<br />
a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)<br />
omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections<br />
and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,<br />
and it may not be used for commercial purposes.</p>

<p class="license">A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in<br />
&#34;The Data Compression Book&#34; by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by<br />
M&amp;T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides<br />
good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods<br />
including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C<br />
code but don&#39;t know much about data compression in general.  The book&#39;s JPEG<br />
sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look<br />
at a full implementation, you&#39;ve got one here...</p>

<p class="license">The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook &#34;JPEG Still<br />
Image Data Compression Standard&#34; by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.<br />
Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.<br />
Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG<br />
standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).<br />
Although this is by far the most detailed and comprehensive exposition of<br />
JPEG publicly available, we point out that it is still missing an explanation<br />
of the most essential properties and algorithms of the underlying DCT<br />
technology.<br />
If you think that you know about DCT-based JPEG after reading this book,<br />
then you are in delusion.  The real fundamentals and corresponding potential<br />
of DCT-based JPEG are not publicly known so far, and that is the reason for<br />
all the mistaken developments taking place in the image coding domain.</p>

<p class="license">The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual<br />
specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is<br />
titled &#34;Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,<br />
Part 1: Requirements and guidelines&#34; and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS<br />
10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled &#34;Digital Compression and Coding of<br />
Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing&#34; and has document<br />
numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.<br />
IJG JPEG 8 introduced an implementation of the JPEG SmartScale extension<br />
which is specified in two documents:  A contributed document at ITU and ISO<br />
with title &#34;ITU-T JPEG-Plus Proposal for Extending ITU-T T.81 for Advanced<br />
Image Coding&#34;, April 2006, Geneva, Switzerland.  The latest version of this<br />
document is Revision 3.  And a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N<br />
5799 with title &#34;Evolution of JPEG&#34;, June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany.<br />
IJG JPEG 9 introduces a reversible color transform for improved lossless<br />
compression which is described in a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/<br />
WG1 N 6080 with title &#34;JPEG 9 Lossless Coding&#34;, June/July 2012, Paris,<br />
France.</p>

<p class="license">The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file<br />
format.  For the omitted details we follow the &#34;JFIF&#34; conventions, version 2.<br />
JFIF version 1 has been adopted as Recommendation ITU-T T.871 (05/2011) :<br />
Information technology - Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone<br />
still images: JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF).  It is available as a<br />
free download in PDF file format from http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.871.<br />
A PDF file of the older JFIF document is available at<br />
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf.</p>

<p class="license">The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from<br />
ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme<br />
found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.<br />
IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).<br />
Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2<br />
(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from<br />
http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision<br />
of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note&#39;s design.<br />
Although IJG&#39;s own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library<br />
uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.</p>

<p class="license">FILE FORMAT WARS<br />
================</p>

<p class="license">The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (previously known as JPEG,<br />
together with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing<br />
the name &#34;JPEG&#34; which is misleading because these formats are incompatible<br />
with original DCT-based JPEG and are based on faulty technologies.<br />
IJG therefore does not and will not support such momentary mistakes<br />
(see REFERENCES).<br />
There exist also distributions under the name &#34;OpenJPEG&#34; promoting such<br />
kind of formats which is misleading because they don&#39;t support original<br />
JPEG images.<br />
We have no sympathy for the promotion of inferior formats.  Indeed, one of<br />
the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force<br />
convergence on common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.<br />
Don&#39;t use an incompatible file format!<br />
(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG<br />
image files indefinitely.)</p>

<p class="license">The ISO committee pretends to be &#34;responsible for the popular JPEG&#34; in their<br />
public reports which is not true because they don&#39;t respond to actual<br />
requirements for the maintenance of the original JPEG specification.<br />
Furthermore, the ISO committee pretends to &#34;ensure interoperability&#34; with<br />
their standards which is not true because their &#34;standards&#34; support only<br />
application-specific and proprietary use cases and contain mathematically<br />
incorrect code.</p>

<p class="license">There are currently different distributions in circulation containing the<br />
name &#34;libjpeg&#34; which is misleading because they don&#39;t have the features and<br />
are incompatible with formats supported by actual IJG libjpeg distributions.<br />
One of those fakes is released by members of the ISO committee and just uses<br />
the name of libjpeg for misdirection of people, similar to the abuse of the<br />
name JPEG as described above, while having nothing in common with actual IJG<br />
libjpeg distributions and containing mathematically incorrect code.<br />
The other one claims to be a &#34;derivative&#34; or &#34;fork&#34; of the original libjpeg,<br />
but violates the license conditions as described under LEGAL ISSUES above<br />
and violates basic C programming properties.<br />
We have no sympathy for the release of misleading, incorrect and illegal<br />
distributions derived from obsolete code bases.<br />
Don&#39;t use an obsolete code base!</p>

<p class="license">According to the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) law, IJG has the lawful and<br />
legal right to foreclose on certain standardization bodies and other<br />
institutions or corporations that knowingly perform substantial and<br />
systematic deceptive acts and practices, fraud, theft, and damaging of the<br />
value of the people of this planet without their knowing, willing and<br />
intentional consent.<br />
The titles, ownership, and rights of these institutions and all their assets<br />
are now duly secured and held in trust for the free people of this planet.<br />
People of the planet, on every country, may have a financial interest in<br />
the assets of these former principals, agents, and beneficiaries of the<br />
foreclosed institutions and corporations.<br />
IJG asserts what is: that each man, woman, and child has unalienable value<br />
and rights granted and deposited in them by the Creator and not any one of<br />
the people is subordinate to any artificial principality, corporate fiction<br />
or the special interest of another without their appropriate knowing,<br />
willing and intentional consent made by contract or accommodation agreement.<br />
IJG expresses that which already was.<br />
The people have already determined and demanded that public administration<br />
entities, national governments, and their supporting judicial systems must<br />
be fully transparent, accountable, and liable.<br />
IJG has secured the value for all concerned free people of the planet.</p>

<p class="license"> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br />
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p class="license">[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br />
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br />
 the version number 2.1.]</p>

<p class="license">                            Preamble</p>

<p class="license">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br />
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br />
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br />
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>

<p class="license">  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br />
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br />
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br />
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br />
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br />
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>

<p class="license">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br />
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br />
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br />
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br />
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br />
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br />
these things.</p>

<p class="license">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br />
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br />
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br />
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>

<p class="license">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br />
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br />
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br />
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br />
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br />
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br />
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>

<p class="license">  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br />
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br />
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>

<p class="license">  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br />
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br />
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br />
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br />
author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br />
introduced by others.</p>

<p class="license">  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br />
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br />
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br />
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br />
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br />
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>

<p class="license">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br />
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br />
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br />
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br />
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br />
libraries into non-free programs.</p>

<p class="license">  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br />
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br />
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br />
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br />
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br />
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br />
the library.</p>

<p class="license">  We call this license the &#34;Lesser&#34; General Public License because it<br />
does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General<br />
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br />
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br />
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br />
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br />
special circumstances.</p>

<p class="license">  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br />
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br />
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br />
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br />
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br />
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br />
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>

<p class="license">  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br />
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br />
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br />
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br />
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br />
system.</p>

<p class="license">  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br />
users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br />
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br />
that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>

<p class="license">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br />
&#34;work based on the library&#34; and a &#34;work that uses the library&#34;.  The<br />
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br />
be combined with the library in order to run.</p>

<p class="license">                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>

<p class="license">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br />
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br />
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br />
this Lesser General Public License (also called &#34;this License&#34;).<br />
Each licensee is addressed as &#34;you&#34;.</p>

<p class="license">  A &#34;library&#34; means a collection of software functions and/or data<br />
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br />
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>

<p class="license">  The &#34;Library&#34;, below, refers to any such software library or work<br />
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &#34;work based on the<br />
Library&#34; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br />
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br />
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br />
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br />
included without limitation in the term &#34;modification&#34;.)</p>

<p class="license">  &#34;Source code&#34; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br />
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br />
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br />
and installation of the library.</p>

<p class="license">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br />
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br />
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br />
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br />
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br />
and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>

<p class="license">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s<br />
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br />
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br />
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br />
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br />
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br />
Library.</p>

<p class="license">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br />
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br />
fee.</p>

<p class="license">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br />
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br />
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br />
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

<p class="license">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>

<p class="license">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br />
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>

<p class="license">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br />
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>

<p class="license">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br />
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br />
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br />
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br />
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br />
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br />
    its purpose remains meaningful.</p>

<p class="license">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br />
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br />
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br />
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br />
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br />
    root function must still compute square roots.)</p>

<p class="license">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br />
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br />
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br />
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br />
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br />
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br />
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br />
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br />
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br />
it.</p>

<p class="license">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br />
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br />
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br />
collective works based on the Library.</p>

<p class="license">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br />
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br />
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br />
the scope of this License.</p>

<p class="license">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br />
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br />
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br />
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br />
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br />
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br />
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br />
these notices.</p>

<p class="license">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br />
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br />
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>

<p class="license">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br />
the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>

<p class="license">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br />
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br />
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br />
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br />
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br />
medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>

<p class="license">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br />
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br />
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br />
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br />
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>

<p class="license">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br />
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br />
linked with it, is called a &#34;work that uses the Library&#34;.  Such a<br />
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br />
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>

<p class="license">  However, linking a &#34;work that uses the Library&#34; with the Library<br />
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br />
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &#34;work that uses the<br />
library&#34;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br />
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>

<p class="license">  When a &#34;work that uses the Library&#34; uses material from a header file<br />
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br />
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br />
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br />
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br />
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>

<p class="license">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br />
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br />
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br />
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br />
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br />
Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>

<p class="license">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br />
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br />
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br />
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>

<p class="license">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br />
link a &#34;work that uses the Library&#34; with the Library to produce a<br />
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br />
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br />
modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse<br />
engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>

<p class="license">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br />
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br />
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br />
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br />
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br />
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br />
of these things:</p>

<p class="license">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br />
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br />
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br />
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br />
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &#34;work that<br />
    uses the Library&#34;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<br />
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br />
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br />
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br />
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br />
    to use the modified definitions.)</p>

<p class="license">    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br />
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br />
    copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,<br />
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br />
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br />
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br />
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</p>

<p class="license">    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br />
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br />
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br />
    than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>

<p class="license">    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br />
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br />
    specified materials from the same place.</p>

<p class="license">    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br />
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>

<p class="license">  For an executable, the required form of the &#34;work that uses the<br />
Library&#34; must include any data and utility programs needed for<br />
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br />
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br />
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br />
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br />
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br />
the executable.</p>

<p class="license">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br />
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br />
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br />
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br />
distribute.</p>

<p class="license">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br />
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br />
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br />
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br />
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br />
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>

<p class="license">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br />
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br />
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br />
    Sections above.</p>

<p class="license">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br />
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br />
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>

<p class="license">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br />
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br />
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br />
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br />
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br />
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br />
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>

<p class="license">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br />
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br />
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br />
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br />
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br />
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br />
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br />
the Library or works based on it.</p>

<p class="license">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br />
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br />
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br />
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br />
restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.<br />
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br />
this License.</p>

<p class="license">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br />
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br />
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br />
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br />
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br />
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br />
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br />
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br />
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>

<p class="license">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br />
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br />
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>

<p class="license">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br />
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br />
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br />
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br />
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br />
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br />
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br />
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br />
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br />
impose that choice.</p>

<p class="license">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br />
be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>

<p class="license">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br />
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br />
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br />
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br />
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br />
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br />
written in the body of this License.</p>

<p class="license">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br />
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br />
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br />
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p class="license">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br />
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br />
&#34;any later version&#34;, you have the option of following the terms and<br />
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br />
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br />
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br />
the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p class="license">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br />
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br />
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br />
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br />
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br />
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br />
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br />
and reuse of software generally.</p>

<p class="license">                            NO WARRANTY</p>

<p class="license">  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br />
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br />
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br />
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &#34;AS IS&#34; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br />
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br />
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br />
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br />
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br />
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

<p class="license">  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br />
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br />
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br />
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br />
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br />
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br />
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br />
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br />
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br />
DAMAGES.</p>

<p class="license">                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<p class="license">           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>

<p class="license">  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br />
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br />
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br />
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br />
ordinary General Public License).</p>

<p class="license">  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br />
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br />
&#34;copyright&#34; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

<p class="license">    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br />
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</p>

<p class="license">    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br />
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br />
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br />
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>

<p class="license">    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br />
    Lesser General Public License for more details.</p>

<p class="license">    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br />
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br />
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA</p>

<p class="license">Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

<p class="license">You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br />
school, if any, to sign a &#34;copyright disclaimer&#34; for the library, if<br />
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>

<p class="license">  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br />
  library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;Derivative Works&#34; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br />
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br />
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br />

      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br />
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br />
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#34;submitted&#34;<br />

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#34;Not a Contribution.&#34;</p>

<p class="license">      &#34;Contributor&#34; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br />
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br />

<p class="license">   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br />
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br />
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>

<p class="license">   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br />
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br />
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br />
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br />
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br />
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br />
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br />
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br />
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br />
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br />
      as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

<p class="license">   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br />
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br />
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br />
      meet the following conditions:</p>

<p class="license">      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br />
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>

<p class="license">      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br />
          stating that You changed the files; and</p>

<p class="license">      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br />
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br />
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br />
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br />
          the Derivative Works; and</p>

<p class="license">      (d) If the Work includes a &#34;NOTICE&#34; text file as part of its<br />
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br />
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br />
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br />
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br />
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br />
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br />
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br />
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br />
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br />
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br />
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br />
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br />
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br />
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br />
          as modifying the License.</p>

<p class="license">      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br />
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br />
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br />
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br />
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br />
      the conditions stated in this License.</p>

<p class="license">   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br />
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br />
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br />
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br />
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br />
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br />
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>

<p class="license">   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br />
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br />
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br />
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

<p class="license">   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br />
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br />
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#34;AS IS&#34; BASIS,<br />
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br />
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br />
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br />
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br />
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>

<p class="license">   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br />
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br />
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br />
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br />
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br />
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br />
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br />
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br />
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br />
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<p class="license">   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br />
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br />
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br />
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br />
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br />
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br />
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br />
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br />
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br />
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

<p class="license">   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

    # assert-plus
  </p>
  <p>
    This library is a super small wrapper over node&#x27;s assert module that has two things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing. Like &#x60;assert.string(myArg, &#x27;myArg&#x27;)&#x60;. As a simple example, most of my code looks like this:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript var assert &#x3D; require(&#x27;assert-plus&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
     function fooAccount(options, callback) { assert.object(options, &#x27;options&#x27;); assert.number(options.id, &#x27;options.id&#x27;); assert.bool(options.isManager, &#x27;options.isManager&#x27;); assert.string(options.name, &#x27;options.name&#x27;); assert.arrayOfString(options.email, &#x27;options.email&#x27;); assert.func(callback, &#x27;callback&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
     // Do stuff callback(null, {}); } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    # API
  </p>
  <p>
    All methods that *aren&#x27;t* part of node&#x27;s core assert API are simply assumed to take an argument, and then a string &#x27;name&#x27; that&#x27;s not a message; &#x60;AssertionError&#x60; will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:
  </p>
  <p>
     AssertionError: foo (string) is required at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9) at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1) at Module._compile (module.js:446:26) at Object..js (module.js:464:10) at Module.load (module.js:353:31) at Function._load (module.js:311:12) at Array.0 (module.js:484:10) at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)
  </p>
  <p>
    from:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript function test(foo) { assert.string(foo, &#x27;foo&#x27;); } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    There you go. You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with &#x60;Arrayof$Type&#x60;:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript function test(foo) { assert.arrayOfString(foo, &#x27;foo&#x27;); } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    You can assert IFF an argument is not &#x60;undefined&#x60; (i.e., an optional arg):
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript assert.optionalString(foo, &#x27;foo&#x27;); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the environment variable &#x60;NODE_NDEBUG&#x3D;1&#x60;. This is pseudo-useful if you have lots of assertions, and don&#x27;t want to pay &#x60;typeof ()&#x60; taxes to v8 in production. Be advised: The standard functions re-exported from &#x60;assert&#x60; are also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified. Using them directly from the &#x60;assert&#x60; module avoids this behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    The complete list of APIs is:
  </p>
  <p>
    * assert.array * assert.bool * assert.buffer * assert.func * assert.number * assert.finite * assert.object * assert.string * assert.stream * assert.date * assert.regexp * assert.uuid * assert.arrayOfArray * assert.arrayOfBool * assert.arrayOfBuffer * assert.arrayOfFunc * assert.arrayOfNumber * assert.arrayOfFinite * assert.arrayOfObject * assert.arrayOfString * assert.arrayOfStream * assert.arrayOfDate * assert.arrayOfRegexp * assert.arrayOfUuid * assert.optionalArray * assert.optionalBool * assert.optionalBuffer * assert.optionalFunc * assert.optionalNumber * assert.optionalFinite * assert.optionalObject * assert.optionalString * assert.optionalStream * assert.optionalDate * assert.optionalRegexp * assert.optionalUuid * assert.optionalArrayOfArray * assert.optionalArrayOfBool * assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer * assert.optionalArrayOfFunc * assert.optionalArrayOfNumber * assert.optionalArrayOfFinite * assert.optionalArrayOfObject * assert.optionalArrayOfString * assert.optionalArrayOfStream * assert.optionalArrayOfDate * assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp * assert.optionalArrayOfUuid * assert.AssertionError * assert.fail * assert.ok * assert.equal * assert.notEqual * assert.deepEqual * assert.notDeepEqual * assert.strictEqual * assert.notStrictEqual * assert.throws * assert.doesNotThrow * assert.ifError
  </p>
  <p>

    # bfs-km-types
  </p>
  <p>
    An SPM module to work with types in JavaScript. Please speak with BFS (@genomelak) before using this.
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Installation
  </p>
  <p>
    Install it using [SPM](https://wiki.spotify.net/wiki/NPM#Alias):
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; $ spm install bfs-km-types &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Basic usage
  </p>
  <p>
    This module consists of several sub-modules. To gain access to these sub-modules, simply require the bfs-km-types module.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that for most sub-modules exporting a single method, only arrays, booleans, numbers, strings and objects as well as null and undefined are accepted.
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Sub-modules
  </p>
  <p>
    ### assert
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports a single method for asserting the strict deep equality between two instances. Useful in testing since it throws an error with the difference summary when differences are found.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    types.assert(one, two); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### check
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports multiple methods for checking the type of an instance. Useful in methods where arguments need to be of certain types. Throws an error if the instance is of the wrong type.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    types.check.array(instance); types.check.boolean(instance); types.check.function(instance); types.check.null(instance); types.check.number(instance); types.check.object(instance); types.check.string(instance); types.check.type(instance, constructor); types.check.undefined(instance); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### clone
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports a single method for deep cloning an instance. Useful for assuring that no other code will mutate the cloned instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    var cloned &#x3D; types.clone(instance); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### compare
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports a single method that produces a difference summary between two instances.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    var summary &#x3D; types.compare(one, two); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### conforms
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports a single method that determines whether an instance has the same type structure as defined by a schema. Useful for sanity checking data.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    if (types.conforms(json, schema)) { ... } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### define
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports a single method that may be used to define a class. This makes the class distinguishable from the global Object type (instanceof checks will report false).
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    var Base &#x3D; function Base() { ... };
  </p>
  <p>
    types.define(Base); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### equals
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports a single method that compares the strict deep equality between two instances. Employs an early exit strategy and does, in contrast to compare, not produce a difference summary.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    if (types.equals(one, two)) { ... } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### extend
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports a single method that may be used to extend a class.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    var Derived &#x3D; function Derived() { Base.call(this, ...); };
  </p>
  <p>
    types.extend(Derived, Base); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### fallback
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports multiple methods for defining fallback values should an instance not be of the correct type.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    var value &#x3D; types.fallback.array(instance, fallback); var value &#x3D; types.fallback.boolean(instance, fallback); var value &#x3D; types.fallback.function(instance, fallback); var value &#x3D; types.fallback.null(instance, fallback); var value &#x3D; types.fallback.number(instance, fallback); var value &#x3D; types.fallback.object(instance, fallback); var value &#x3D; types.fallback.type(instance, constructor, fallback); var value &#x3D; types.fallback.undefined(instance, fallback); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### is
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports multiple methods for checking whether an instance is of a certain type.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    if (types.is.array(instance)) { ... }
  </p>
  <p>
    if (types.is.boolean(instance)) { ... }
  </p>
  <p>
    if (types.is.function(instance)) { ... }
  </p>
  <p>
    if (types.is.null(instance)) { ... }
  </p>
  <p>
    if (types.is.number(instance)) { ... }
  </p>
  <p>
    if (types.is.object(instance)) { ... }
  </p>
  <p>
    if (types.is.string(instance)) { ... }
  </p>
  <p>
    if (types.is.type(instance, constructor)) { ... }
  </p>
  <p>
    if (types.is.undefined(instance)) { ... } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### mock
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports a single method that creates mocks for a type. Behaviour can be mocked by shadowing methods on the prototype of the mocked type.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    var Mockee &#x3D; function Mockee() { ... };
  </p>
  <p>
    types.define(Mockee);
  </p>
  <p>
    Mockee.prototype.doSomething &#x3D; function () { ... };
  </p>
  <p>
    var Mocked &#x3D; types.mock(Mockee);
  </p>
  <p>
    Mocked.prototype.doSomething &#x3D; function () { ... }; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### name
  </p>
  <p>
    Exports a single method that attempts to read the type name for an instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var types &#x3D; require(&#x27;bfs-km-types&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>

    # dom-helpers
  </p>
  <p>
    tiny modular DOM lib for ie8+
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Install
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh npm i -S dom-helpers &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Mostly just naive wrappers around common DOM API inconsistencies, Cross browser work is minimal and mostly taken from jQuery. This library doesn&#x27;t do a lot to normalize behavior across browsers, it mostly seeks to provide a common interface, and eliminate the need to write the same damn &#x60;if (ie8)&#x60; statements in every project.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example &#x60;events.on&#x60; works in all browsers ie8+ but it uses the native event system so actual event oddities will continue to exist. If you need __robust__ cross-browser support, use jQuery. If you are just tired of rewriting:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js if (document.addEventListener) return (node, eventName, handler, capture) &#x3D;&gt; node.addEventListener(eventName, handler, capture || false); else if (document.attachEvent) return (node, eventName, handler) &#x3D;&gt; node.attachEvent(&#x27;on&#x27; + eventName, handler); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    over and over again, or you need a ok &#x60;getComputedStyle&#x60; polyfill but don&#x27;t want to include all of jQuery, use this.
  </p>
  <p>
    dom-helpers does expect certain, polyfillable, es5 features to be present for which you can use &#x60;es5-shim&#x60; for ie8
  </p>
  <p>
    The real advantage to this collection is that any method can be required individually, meaning tools like Browserify or webpack will only include the exact methods you use. This is great for environments where jQuery doesn&#x27;t make sense, such as &#x60;React&#x60; where you only occasionally need to do direct DOM manipulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each level of the module can be required as a whole or you can drill down for a specific method or section:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var helpers &#x3D; require(&#x27;dom-helpers&#x27;) var query &#x3D; require(&#x27;dom-helpers/query&#x27;) var offset &#x3D; require(&#x27;dom-helpers/query/offset&#x27;)
  </p>
  <p>
     // style is a function require(&#x27;dom-helpers/style&#x27;)(node, { width: &#x27;40px&#x27; })
  </p>
  <p>
     //and a namespace var gcs &#x3D; require(&#x27;dom-helpers/style/getComputedStyle&#x27;) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>

  <p>
    # domify
  </p>
  <p>
    Turn HTML into DOM elements x-browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Usage
  </p>
  <p>
    Works out of the box in the browser:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var domify &#x3D; require(&#x27;domify&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    document.addEventListener(&#x27;DOMContentLoaded&#x27;, function() { var el &#x3D; domify(&#x27;&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#x27;); document.body.appendChild(el); }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also run it in *node* and *iojs*. Just pass a custom implementation of &#x60;document&#x60;:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var jsdom &#x3D; require(&#x27;jsdom&#x27;).jsdom();
  </p>
  <p>
    domify(&#x27;&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#x27;, jsdom.defaultView.document); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Running tests
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; $ npm i -g component-test $ make $ component-test browser &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

  </p>
  <p>
    # SYNOPSIS
  </p>
  <p>
    EventEmitter2 is an implementation of the EventEmitter found in Node.js
  </p>
  <p>
    # DESCRIPTION
  </p>
  <p>
    ### FEATURES - Namespaces/Wildcards. - Times To Listen (TTL), extends the &#x60;once&#x60; concept with &#x60;many&#x60;. - Browser environment compatibility. - Demonstrates good performance in benchmarks
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; EventEmitterHeatUp x 3,728,965 ops/sec \302\2610.68% (60 runs sampled) EventEmitter x 2,822,904 ops/sec \302\2610.74% (63 runs sampled) EventEmitter2 x 7,251,227 ops/sec \302\2610.55% (58 runs sampled) EventEmitter2 (wild) x 3,220,268 ops/sec \302\2610.44% (65 runs sampled) Fastest is EventEmitter2 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Differences (Non breaking, compatible with existing EventEmitter)
  </p>
  <p>
     - The constructor takes a configuration object.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript var EventEmitter2 &#x3D; require(&#x27;eventemitter2&#x27;).EventEmitter2; var server &#x3D; new EventEmitter2({
  </p>
  <p>
     // // use wildcards. // wildcard: true,
  </p>
  <p>
     // // the delimiter used to segment namespaces, defaults to &#x60;.&#x60;. // delimiter: &#x27;::&#x27;, 
  </p>
  <p>
     // // if you want to emit the newListener event set to true. // newListener: false, 
  </p>
  <p>
     // // max listeners that can be assigned to an event, default 10. // maxListeners: 20 }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
     - Getting the actual event that fired.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript server.on(&#x27;foo.*&#x27;, function(value1, value2) { console.log(this.event, value1, value2); }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
     - Fire an event N times and then remove it, an extension of the &#x60;once&#x60; concept.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript server.many(&#x27;foo&#x27;, 4, function() { console.log(&#x27;hello&#x27;); }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
     - Pass in a namespaced event as an array rather than a delimited string.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript server.many([&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;bazz&#x27;], function() { console.log(&#x27;hello&#x27;); }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    # API
  </p>
  <p>
    When an &#x60;EventEmitter&#x60; instance experiences an error, the typical action is to emit an &#x60;error&#x60; event. Error events are treated as a special case. If there is no listener for it, then the default action is to print a stack trace and exit the program.
  </p>
  <p>
    All EventEmitters emit the event &#x60;newListener&#x60; when new listeners are added.
  </p>
  <p>
    **Namespaces** with **Wildcards** To use namespaces/wildcards, pass the &#x60;wildcard&#x60; option into the EventEmitter constructor. When namespaces/wildcards are enabled, events can either be strings (&#x60;foo.bar&#x60;) separated by a delimiter or arrays (&#x60;[&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;]&#x60;). The delimiter is also configurable as a constructor option.
  </p>
  <p>
    An event name passed to any event emitter method can contain a wild card (the &#x60;*&#x60; character). If the event name is a string, a wildcard may appear as &#x60;foo.*&#x60;. If the event name is an array, the wildcard may appear as &#x60;[&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;*&#x27;]&#x60;.
  </p>
  <p>
    If either of the above described events were passed to the &#x60;on&#x60; method, subsequent emits such as the following would be observed...
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript emitter.emit(&#x27;foo.bazz&#x27;); emitter.emit([&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;]); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### emitter.addListener(event, listener) ### emitter.on(event, listener)
  </p>
  <p>
    Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript server.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, function(value1, value2, value3, ...) { console.log(&#x27;The event was raised!&#x27;); }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript server.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, function(value) { console.log(&#x27;The event was raised!&#x27;); }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### emitter.onAny(listener)
  </p>
  <p>
    Adds a listener that will be fired when any event is emitted.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript server.onAny(function(value) { console.log(&#x27;All events trigger this.&#x27;); }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### emitter.offAny(listener)
  </p>
  <p>
    Removes the listener that will be fired when any event is emitted.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript server.offAny(function(value) { console.log(&#x27;The event was raised!&#x27;); }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    #### emitter.once(event, listener)
  </p>
  <p>
    Adds a **one time** listener for the event. The listener is invoked only the first time the event is fired, after which it is removed.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript server.once(&#x27;get&#x27;, function (value) { console.log(&#x27;Ah, we have our first value!&#x27;); }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### emitter.many(event, timesToListen, listener)
  </p>
  <p>
    Adds a listener that will execute **n times** for the event before being removed. The listener is invoked only the first **n times** the event is fired, after which it is removed.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript server.many(&#x27;get&#x27;, 4, function (value) { console.log(&#x27;This event will be listened to exactly four times.&#x27;); }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### emitter.removeListener(event, listener) ### emitter.off(event, listener)
  </p>
  <p>
    Remove a listener from the listener array for the specified event. **Caution**: changes array indices in the listener array behind the listener.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript var callback &#x3D; function(value) { console.log(&#x27;someone connected!&#x27;); }; server.on(&#x27;get&#x27;, callback); // ... server.removeListener(&#x27;get&#x27;, callback); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### emitter.removeAllListeners([event])
  </p>
  <p>
    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified event.
  </p>
  <p>
    ### emitter.setMaxListeners(n)
  </p>
  <p>
    By default EventEmitters will print a warning if more than 10 listeners are added to it. This is a useful default which helps finding memory leaks. Obviously not all Emitters should be limited to 10. This function allows that to be increased. Set to zero for unlimited.
  </p>
  <p>
    ### emitter.listeners(event)
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns an array of listeners for the specified event. This array can be manipulated, e.g. to remove listeners.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript server.on(&#x27;get&#x27;, function(value) { console.log(&#x27;someone connected!&#x27;); }); console.log(server.listeners(&#x27;get&#x27;)); // [ [Function] ] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### emitter.listenersAny()
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns an array of listeners that are listening for any event that is specified. This array can be manipulated, e.g. to remove listeners.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript server.onAny(function(value) { console.log(&#x27;someone connected!&#x27;); }); console.log(server.listenersAny()[0]); // [ [Function] ] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### emitter.emit(event, [arg1], [arg2], [...])
  </p>
  <p>
    Execute each of the listeners that may be listening for the specified event name in order with the list of arguments.

    # Fast Diff [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhchen/fast-diff.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jhchen/fast-diff)
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a simplified import of the excellent [diff-match-patch](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) library by [Neil Fraser](https://neil.fraser.name/) into the Node.js environment. The match and patch parts are removed, as well as all the extra diff options. What is incredibly fast diffing between two strings.
  </p>
  <p>
     The diff function is an implementation of [&quot;An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations&quot; (Myers, 1986)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi&#x3D;10.1.1.4.6927&amp;rep&#x3D;rep1&amp;type&#x3D;pdf) with the suggested divide and conquer strategy along with several [optimizations](http://neil.fraser.name/news/2007/10/09/) Neil added.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var diff &#x3D; require(&#x27;fast-diff&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    var good &#x3D; &#x27;Good dog&#x27;; var bad &#x3D; &#x27;Bad dog&#x27;;
  </p>

    # findAndReplaceDOMText
  </p>
  <p>
    **[See the demo](http://padolsey.github.com/findAndReplaceDOMText/demo.html)**
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;findAndReplaceDOMText&#x60; searches for regular expression matches in a given DOM node and replaces or wraps each match with a node or piece of text that you can specify.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html &lt;p id&#x3D;&quot;t&quot;&gt; 123 456 Hello &lt;/p&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js findAndReplaceDOMText(document.getElementById(&#x27;t&#x27;), { find: /Hello/, wrap: &#x27;em&#x27; }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    This would result in:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html &lt;p id&#x3D;&quot;t&quot;&gt; 123 456 &lt;em&gt;Hello&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    And it also works when matches are spread **across multiple nodes**! E.g.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html &lt;p id&#x3D;&quot;t&quot;&gt; 123 456 Hell&lt;span&gt;o Goodbye&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js findAndReplaceDOMText(document.getElementById(&#x27;t&#x27;), { find: /Hello/, wrap: &#x27;em&#x27; }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    This would result in:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html &lt;p id&#x3D;&quot;t&quot;&gt; 123 456 &lt;em&gt;Hell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; Goodbye&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    The &#x60;EM&#x60; element has been added twice, to cover both portions of the match.
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Installation
  </p>
  <p>
    Grab the latest [findAndReplaceDOMText.js](https://github.com/padolsey/findAndReplaceDOMText/blob/master/src/findAndReplaceDOMText.js) (or &#x60;npm install findandreplacedomtext&#x60;) and include it as a &#x60;&lt;script&gt;&#x60; on your page.
  </p>
  <p>
    ## API / Usage
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;findAndReplaceDOMText&#x60; has the following argument signature:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js findAndReplaceDOMText( element, // (Element) The element or text-node to search within options // (Object) Explained below ); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### API
  </p>
  <p>
    #### Options
  </p>
  <p>
    The &#x60;options&#x60; object includes:
  </p>
  <p>
     * **find** (&#x60;RegExp | String&#x60;): Something to search for. A string will perform a global search by default (looking for all matches), but a RegExp will only do so if you include the global (&#x60;/.../g&#x60;) flag. * **replace** *optional* (&#x60;String | Function&#x60;): A String of text to replace matches with, or a Function which should return replacement Node or String. If you use a string, it can contain various tokens: * &#x60;$n&#x60; to represent the *n*th captured group of a regular expression (i.e. &#x60;$1&#x60;, &#x60;$2&#x60;, ...) * &#x60;$0&#x60; or &#x60;$&amp;&#x60; to represent the entire match * &lt;code&gt;$&#x60;&lt;/code&gt; to represent everything to the left of the match. * &#x60;$&#x27;&#x60; to represent everything to the right of the match. * **wrap** *optional* (&#x60;String | Node&#x60;): A string representing the node-name of an element that will be wrapped around matches (e.g. &#x60;span&#x60; or &#x60;em&#x60;). Or a Node (i.e. a stencil node) that we will clone for each match portion. * **wrapClass** *optional* (&#x60;String&#x60;): A string representing the class name to be assigned to the wrapping element (e.g. &#x60;&lt;span class&#x3D;&quot;myClass&quot;&gt;found text&lt;/span&gt;&#x60;). If the &#x60;wrap&#x60; option is not specified, then this option is ignored. * **portionMode** *optional* (&#x60;String&#x60;, one of &#x60;&quot;retain&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;&quot;first&quot;&#x60;): Indicates whether to re-use existing node boundaries when replacing a match with text (i.e. the default, &#x60;&quot;retain&quot;&#x60;), or whether to instead place the entire replacement in the first-found match portion&#x27;s node. *Most of the time you&#x27;ll want the default*. * **filterElements** *optional* (&#x60;Function&#x60;): A function to be called on every element encountered by &#x60;findAndReplaceDOMText&#x60;. If the function returns false the element will be altogether ignored. * **forceContext** *optional* (&#x60;Function | Boolean&#x60;): A boolean or a boolean-returning function that&#x27;ll be called on every element to determine if it should be considered as its own matching context. See below under [*Contexts*](#user-content-contexts) for more info. * **preset** *optional* (&#x60;String&#x60;): Currently there&#x27;s only one preset: &#x60;prose&#x60;. See below.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### &#x60;preset:prose&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    The most common usage of &#x60;findAndReplaceDOMText&#x60; is to replace text found in regular prose, not all DOM nodes. To make this easier there is a preset that you can use to instruct it to:
  </p>
  <p>
     * Ignore non-textual elements (E.g. &#x60;&lt;script&gt;&#x60;, &#x60;&lt;svg&gt;&#x60;, &#x60;&lt;optgroup&gt;&#x60;, &#x60;&lt;textarea&gt;&#x60;, etc.) * Force [bordered contexts](#user-content-contexts) on block-elements like &#x60;&lt;p&gt;&#x60; and &#x60;&lt;div&gt;&#x60; so that matches cannot cross element borders. * Note: matches will still be able to cross textual-inline element borders (&#x60;&lt;em&gt;&#x60;, &#x60;&lt;span&gt;&#x60;, etc.)
  </p>
  <p>
    To enable this preset:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js findAndReplaceDOMText(element, { preset: &#x27;prose&#x27;, find: &#x27;something&#x27;, replace: &#x27;something else&#x27; }) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    #### What is a portion?
  </p>
  <p>
    A portion or &quot;match portion&quot; is a part of a match that is delimited by node boundaries. Not all matches occur within a single text-node, so &#x60;findAndReplaceDOMText&#x60; has to be able to deal with cross-boundary matches (e.g. when matching &#x60;/foo/&#x60; in &#x60;&quot;&lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;oo&quot;&#x60;).
  </p>
  <p>
    A portion object has the following properties:
  </p>
  <p>
     * &#x60;node&#x60;: The DOM node pertaining to the portion. Note that this node might not fully encapsulate part of a match, e.g. the node might contain additional text. * &#x60;index&#x60;: The index of the portion (&#x60;0&#x60; is the first portion of the match, etc.) * &#x60;text&#x60;: The text of the portion relevant to the match * &#x60;indexInMatch&#x60;: The index of the portion within the match * &#x60;indexInNode&#x60;: The index of the portion text within the node
  </p>
  <p>
    #### The &#x60;replace&#x60; Function
  </p>
  <p>
    If you pass a function to the &#x60;replace&#x60; option your function will be called on every portion of every match and is expected to return a DOM Node (a Text or Element node). Your function will be passed both the portion and the encapsulating match of that portion.
  </p>

    E.g.
  </p>
  <p>
    *Input HTML*
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html &lt;div id&#x3D;&quot;container&quot;&gt; Explaining how to write a replace &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;ction &lt;/div&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    *JS*
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js findAndReplaceDOMText(document.getElementById(&#x27;container&#x27;), { find: &#x27;function&#x27;, replace: function(portion, match) { return &#x27;[[&#x27; + portion.index + &#x27;]]&#x27;; } }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    *Output HTML*
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html &lt;div id&#x3D;&quot;container&quot;&gt; Explaining how to write a replace &lt;em&gt;[[0]]&lt;/em&gt;[[1]] &lt;/div&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    #### The &#x60;wrap&#x60; Option
  </p>
  <p>
    If you pass a string to the &#x60;wrap&#x60; option, every matching text segment will be wrapped in that element. If you also specify the &#x60;wrapClass&#x60; option, the wrapping element will be assigned that class after it is created. This is useful for attaching various styles from your css.
  </p>
  <p>
    E.g.
  </p>
  <p>
    *Input HTML*
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html &lt;div id&#x3D;&quot;container&quot;&gt; Explaining how to wrap text in elements with and without classes assigned. &lt;/div&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    *JS*
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js findAndReplaceDOMText(document.getElementById(&#x27;container&#x27;), { find: &#x27;without&#x27;, wrap: &#x27;em&#x27; }); findAndReplaceDOMText(document.getElementById(&#x27;container&#x27;), { find: &#x27;with &#x27;, wrap: &#x27;em&#x27;, wrapClass: &#x27;shiny&#x27; }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    *CSS*
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;css .shiny { background-color: yellow; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    *Output HTML*
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html &lt;div id&#x3D;&quot;container&quot;&gt; Explaining how to wrap text in elements &lt;em class&#x3D;&quot;shiny&quot;&gt;with &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; classes assigned. &lt;/div&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    #### The instance
  </p>
  <p>
    Calling &#x60;findAndReplaceDOMText&#x60; returns an instance of an internal Finder constructor -- the API on the object is limited, at the moment, to reverting:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var finder &#x3D; findAndReplaceDOMText(...);
  </p>
  <p>
    // Later: finder.revert(); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    **Note:** Reversion will only work if the nodes have not been tampered with after the initial replacement -- if there have been removals, movements or normalisations then the reversion is not guarenteed to work. In this case it&#x27;s best to retain your own clone of the target node(s) in order to run your own reversion.
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Contexts
  </p>
  <p>
    Matching, by default, will occur on all elements and across all element borders. E.g.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html &lt;div id&#x3D;&quot;test&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;ama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;zing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js findAndReplaceDOMText(document.getElementById(&#x27;test&#x27;), { find: &#x27;amazing&#x27;, wrap: &#x27;em&#x27; }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    After:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html &lt;div id&#x3D;&quot;test&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;zing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

    This is a useful feature for inline elements, but is undesirable in many other cases, so to stop it from happening you can choose to &quot;force a context&quot; on those particular elements. In this case we want to force a context on &#x60;&lt;p&gt;&#x60; elements:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js findAndReplaceDOMText(document.getElementById(&#x27;test&#x27;), { find: &#x27;amazing&#x27;, wrap: &#x27;em&#x27;, forceContext: function(el) { // Using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/matches return el.matches(&#x27;p&#x27;); } }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Internally, the &#x60;prose&#x60; preset uses this feature:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js exposed.PRESETS &#x3D; { prose: { forceContext: exposed.NON_INLINE_PROSE, filterElements: function(el) { return !hasOwn.call(exposed.NON_PROSE_ELEMENTS, el.nodeName.toLowerCase()); } } }; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>

    # jest-worker
  </p>
  <p>
    Module for executing heavy tasks under forked processes in parallel, by providing a &#x60;Promise&#x60; based interface, minimum overhead, and bound workers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The module works by providing an absolute path of the module to be loaded in all forked processes. Files relative to a node module are also accepted. All methods are exposed on the parent process as promises, so they can be &#x60;await&#x60;&#x27;ed. Child (worker) methods can either be synchronous or asynchronous.
  </p>
  <p>
    The module also implements support for bound workers. Binding a worker means that, based on certain parameters, the same task will always be executed by the same worker. The way bound workers work is by using the returned string of the &#x60;computeWorkerKey&#x60; method. If the string was used before for a task, the call will be queued to the related worker that processed the task earlier; if not, it will be executed by the first available worker, then sticked to the worker that executed it; so the next time it will be processed by the same worker. If you have no preference on the worker executing the task, but you have defined a &#x60;computeWorkerKey&#x60; method because you want _some_ of the tasks to be sticked, you can return &#x60;null&#x60; from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The list of exposed methods can be explicitly provided via the &#x60;exposedMethods&#x60; option. If it is not provided, it will be obtained by requiring the child module into the main process, and analyzed via reflection. Check the &quot;minimal example&quot; section for a valid one.
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Install
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh $ yarn add jest-worker &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Example
  </p>
  <p>
    This example covers the minimal usage:
  </p>
  <p>
    ### File &#x60;parent.js&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript import Worker from &#x27;jest-worker&#x27;;
  </p>
  <p>
    async function main() { const worker &#x3D; new Worker(require.resolve(&#x27;./worker&#x27;)); const result &#x3D; await worker.hello(&#x27;Alice&#x27;); // &quot;Hello, Alice&quot; }
  </p>
  <p>
    main(); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### File &#x60;worker.js&#x60;

  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript export function hello(param) { return &#x27;Hello, &#x27; + param; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ## API
  </p>
  <p>
    The only exposed method is a constructor (&#x60;Worker&#x60;) that is initialized by passing the worker path, plus an options object.
  </p>
  <p>
    ### &#x60;workerPath: string&#x60; (required)
  </p>
  <p>
    Node module name or absolute path of the file to be loaded in the child processes. Use &#x60;require.resolve&#x60; to transform a relative path into an absolute one.
  </p>
  <p>
    ### &#x60;options: Object&#x60; (optional)
  </p>
  <p>
    #### &#x60;exposedMethods: $ReadOnlyArray&lt;string&gt;&#x60; (optional)
  </p>
  <p>
    List of method names that can be called on the child processes from the parent process. You cannot expose any method named like a public &#x60;Worker&#x60; method, or starting with &#x60;_&#x60;. If you use method auto-discovery, then these methods will not be exposed, even if they exist.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### &#x60;numWorkers: number&#x60; (optional)
  </p>
  <p>
    Amount of workers to spawn. Defaults to the number of CPUs minus 1.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### &#x60;maxRetries: number&#x60; (optional)
  </p>
  <p>
    Maximum amount of times that a dead child can be re-spawned, per call. Defaults to &#x60;3&#x60;, pass &#x60;Infinity&#x60; to allow endless retries.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### &#x60;forkOptions: Object&#x60; (optional)
  </p>
  <p>
    Allow customizing all options passed to &#x60;childProcess.fork&#x60;. By default, some values are set (&#x60;cwd&#x60;, &#x60;env&#x60; and &#x60;execArgv&#x60;), but you can override them and customize the rest. For a list of valid values, check [the Node documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options).
  </p>
  <p>
    #### &#x60;computeWorkerKey: (method: string, ...args: Array&lt;any&gt;) &#x3D;&gt; ?string&#x60; (optional)
  </p>
  <p>
    Every time a method exposed via the API is called, &#x60;computeWorkerKey&#x60; is also called in order to bound the call to a worker. This is useful for workers that are able to cache the result or part of it. You bound calls to a worker by making &#x60;computeWorkerKey&#x60; return the same identifier for all different calls. If you do not want to bind the call to any worker, return &#x60;null&#x60;.
  </p>
  <p>
    The callback you provide is called with the method name, plus all the rest of the arguments of the call. Thus, you have full control to decide what to return. Check a practical example on bound workers under the &quot;bound worker usage&quot; section.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, no process is bound to any worker.
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Worker
  </p>
  <p>
    The returned &#x60;Worker&#x60; instance has all the exposed methods, plus some additional ones to interact with the workers itself:
  </p>
  <p>
    ### &#x60;getStdout(): Readable&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns a &#x60;ReadableStream&#x60; where the standard output of all workers is piped. Note that the &#x60;silent&#x60; option of the child workers must be set to &#x60;true&#x60; to make it work. This is the default set by &#x60;jest-worker&#x60;, but keep it in mind when overriding options through &#x60;forkOptions&#x60;.
  </p>
  <p>
    ### &#x60;getStderr(): Readable&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns a &#x60;ReadableStream&#x60; where the standard error of all workers is piped. Note that the &#x60;silent&#x60; option of the child workers must be set to &#x60;true&#x60; to make it work. This is the default set by &#x60;jest-worker&#x60;, but keep it in mind when overriding options through &#x60;forkOptions&#x60;.
  </p>
  <p>
    ### &#x60;end()&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Finishes the workers by killing all workers. No further calls can be done to the &#x60;Worker&#x60; instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    **Note:** Each worker has a unique id (index that starts with &#x60;1&#x60;) which is available on &#x60;process.env.JEST_WORKER_ID&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    # More examples
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Standard usage
  </p>
  <p>
    This example covers the standard usage:
  </p>
  <p>
    ### File &#x60;parent.js&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript import Worker from &#x27;jest-worker&#x27;;
  </p>
  <p>
    async function main() { const myWorker &#x3D; new Worker(require.resolve(&#x27;./worker&#x27;), { exposedMethods: [&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;getWorkerId&#x27;], numWorkers: 4, });
  </p>
  <p>
     console.log(await myWorker.foo(&#x27;Alice&#x27;)); // &quot;Hello from foo: Alice&quot; console.log(await myWorker.bar(&#x27;Bob&#x27;)); // &quot;Hello from bar: Bob&quot; console.log(await myWorker.getWorkerId()); // &quot;3&quot; -&gt; this message has sent from the 3rd worker
  </p>
  <p>
     myWorker.end(); }
  </p>
  <p>
    main(); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### File &#x60;worker.js&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript export function foo(param) { return &#x27;Hello from foo: &#x27; + param; }
  </p>
  <p>
    export function bar(param) { return &#x27;Hello from bar: &#x27; + param; }
  </p>
  <p>
    export function getWorkerId() { return process.env.JEST_WORKER_ID; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Bound worker usage:
  </p>
  <p>
    This example covers the usage with a &#x60;computeWorkerKey&#x60; method:
  </p>
  <p>
    ### File &#x60;parent.js&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript import Worker from &#x27;jest-worker&#x27;;
  </p>
  <p>
    async function main() { const myWorker &#x3D; new Worker(require.resolve(&#x27;./worker&#x27;), { computeWorkerKey: (method, filename) &#x3D;&gt; filename, });
  </p>
  <p>
     // Transform the given file, within the first available worker. console.log(await myWorker.transform(&#x27;/tmp/foo.js&#x27;));
  </p>
  <p>
     // Wait a bit. await sleep(10000);
  </p>
  <p>
     // Transform the same file again. Will immediately return because the // transformed file is cached in the worker, and &#x60;computeWorkerKey&#x60; ensures // the same worker that processed the file the first time will process it now. console.log(await myWorker.transform(&#x27;/tmp/foo.js&#x27;));
  </p>
  <p>
     myWorker.end(); }
  </p>
  <p>
    main(); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### File &#x60;worker.js&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript import babel from &#x27;babel-core&#x27;;
  </p>
  <p>
    const cache &#x3D; Object.create(null);
  </p>
  <p>
    export function transform(filename) { if (cache[filename]) { return cache[filename]; }
  </p>
  <p>
     // jest-worker can handle both immediate results and thenables. If a // thenable is returned, it will be await&#x27;ed until it resolves. return new Promise((resolve, reject) &#x3D;&gt; { babel.transformFile(filename, (err, result) &#x3D;&gt; { if (err) { reject(err); } else { resolve((cache[filename] &#x3D; result)); } }); }); } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

    # Background
  </p>
  <p>
    The original [jsonify](https://github.com/substack/jsonify) package is basically just an npm-ification of Douglas Crockford&#x27;s [JSON-js](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) lib, which is licensed under a Public Domain license. [He refuses to re-license it under another license](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/pull/70#issuecomment-147370965), and states that:
  </p>
  <p>
    &gt;If you cannot tolerate Public Domain, then I recommend that you not use this software.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since [Spotify&#x27;s FOSS board has stated we can&#x27;t just use Public Domain software at will](https://foss.spotify.net/docs/policy/06-license-table.html) because of the unclear legal implications, we can&#x27;t use the original [jsonify](https://github.com/substack/jsonify) package. However, it is used in multiple places deep down in our dependency graph, so it&#x27;s hard to chery-pick it away. Instead, we run &#x60;yarn add file:libs/jsonify&#x60;, which manually overwrites it with this package, which just aliases the native JSON methods.

    #No training, no prolog. A Natural-Language-Processing library *in Javascript*, small-enough for the browser, and quick-enough to run on keypress :two_men_holding_hands:
  </p>
  <p>
    It does [tons of clever things](http://rawgit.com/spencermountain/nlp_compromise/master/client_side/basic_demo/index.html). it&#x27;s smaller than jquery, and scores 86% on the [Penn treebank](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/). &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript nlp.pos(&#x27;she sells seashells by the seashore&#x27;).to_past().text() //she sold seashells by the seashore &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/nlp_compromise.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/nlp_compromise) ##Check it out

    ##Justification If the 80-20 rule applies for most things, the &#x27;&#x27;94-6 rule&#x27;&#x27; applies when working with language - by [Zipfs law](http://www.businessinsider.com/zipfs-law-and-the-most-common-words-in-english-2013-10): &gt;The **[top 10 words](http://www.businessinsider.com/zipfs-law-and-the-most-common-words-in-english-2013-10)** account for 25% of used language.
  </p>
  <p>
    &gt;The **top 100 words** account for 50% of used language.
  </p>
  <p>
    &gt;The **top 50,000 words** account for 95% of used language.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the [Penn treebank](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/), for example, this is possible:
  </p>
  <p>
    * just a 1 thousand word lexicon: **45% accuracy** * ... then falling back to nouns: **70% accuracy** * ... then some suffix regexes: **74% accuracy** * ... then some sentence-level postprocessing: **81% accuracy**
  </p>
  <p>
    The process is to get some curated data, find the patterns, and list the exceptions. Bada bing, bada boom. In this way a satisfactory NLP library can be built with breathtaking lightness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Namely, it can be run right on the user&#x27;s computer instead of a server.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    ####Lexicon Because the library can conjugate all sorts of forms, it only needs to store one grammatical form. The lexicon was built using the [American National Corpus](http://www.americannationalcorpus.org/), then intersected with the regex rule-list. For example, it lists only 300 verbs, then blasts-out their 1200+ derived forms.
  </p>
  <p>
    ####Contractions It puts a &#x27;silent token&#x27; into the phrase for contractions. Otherwise a meaningful part-of-speech could be neglected. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript nlp.pos(&quot;i&#x27;m good.&quot;) [{ text:&quot;i&#x27;m&quot;, normalised:&quot;i&quot;, pos:&quot;PRP&quot; }, { text:&quot;&quot;, normalised:&quot;am&quot;, pos:&quot;CP&quot; }, { text:&quot;good.&quot;, normalised:&quot;good&quot;, pos:&quot;JJ&quot; }] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ####Tokenization Neighbouring words with the same part of speech are merged together, unless there is punctuation, different capitalisation, or some special cases. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript nlp.pos(&quot;tony hawk won&quot;).tags() //tony hawk NN //won VB &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; To turn this off: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript nlp.pos(&quot;tony hawk won&quot;, {dont_combine:true}).tags() //tony NN //hawk NN //won VB &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ####Phrasal Verbs &#x27;beef up&#x27; is one verb, and not some direction of beefing.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
  </p>
  <p>
    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  </p>
  <p>
    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
  </p>
  <p>
    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
  </p>
  <p>
    If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

  <p>
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  </p>
  <p>
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  </p>
  <p>
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.

  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;psl&#x60; is a &#x60;JavaScript&#x60; domain name parser based on the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/).
  </p>
  <p>
    This implementation is tested against the [test data hosted by Mozilla](http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/test/unit/data/test_psl.txt?raw&#x3D;1) and kindly provided by [Comodo](https://www.comodo.com/).
  </p>
  <p>
    ## What is the Public Suffix List?
  </p>
  <p>
    The Public Suffix List is a cross-vendor initiative to provide an accurate list of domain name suffixes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Public Suffix List is an initiative of the Mozilla Project, but is maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any software, but was originally created to meet the needs of browser manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
    A &quot;public suffix&quot; is one under which Internet users can directly register names. Some examples of public suffixes are &quot;.com&quot;, &quot;.co.uk&quot; and &quot;pvt.k12.wy.us&quot;. The Public Suffix List is a list of all known public suffixes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Source: http://publicsuffix.org
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Installation
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Node.js
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh npm install --save psl &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Browser
  </p>
  <p>
    Download [psl.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wrangr/psl/master/dist/psl.min.js) and include it in a script tag.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html &lt;script src&#x3D;&quot;psl.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    This script is browserified and wrapped in a [umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) wrapper so you should be able to use it standalone or together with a module loader.
  </p>
  <p>
    ## API
  </p>
  <p>
    ### &#x60;psl.parse(domain)&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Parse domain based on Public Suffix List. Returns an &#x60;Object&#x60; with the following properties:
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;tld&#x60;: Top level domain (this is the _public suffix_). * &#x60;sld&#x60;: Second level domain (the first private part of the domain name). * &#x60;domain&#x60;: The domain name is the &#x60;sld&#x60; + &#x60;tld&#x60;. * &#x60;subdomain&#x60;: Optional parts left of the domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### Example:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var psl &#x3D; require(&#x27;psl&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    // Parse domain without subdomain var parsed &#x3D; psl.parse(&#x27;google.com&#x27;); console.log(parsed.tld); // &#x27;com&#x27; console.log(parsed.sld); // &#x27;google&#x27; console.log(parsed.domain); // &#x27;google.com&#x27; console.log(parsed.subdomain); // null
  </p>
  <p>
    // Parse domain with subdomain var parsed &#x3D; psl.parse(&#x27;www.google.com&#x27;); console.log(parsed.tld); // &#x27;com&#x27; console.log(parsed.sld); // &#x27;google&#x27; console.log(parsed.domain); // &#x27;google.com&#x27; console.log(parsed.subdomain); // &#x27;www&#x27;
  </p>
  <p>
    // Parse domain with nested subdomains var parsed &#x3D; psl.parse(&#x27;a.b.c.d.foo.com&#x27;); console.log(parsed.tld); // &#x27;com&#x27; console.log(parsed.sld); // &#x27;foo&#x27; console.log(parsed.domain); // &#x27;foo.com&#x27; console.log(parsed.subdomain); // &#x27;a.b.c.d&#x27; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### &#x60;psl.get(domain)&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Get domain name, &#x60;sld&#x60; + &#x60;tld&#x60;. Returns &#x60;null&#x60; if not valid.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### Example:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var psl &#x3D; require(&#x27;psl&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    // null input. psl.get(null); // null
  </p>
  <p>
    // Mixed case. psl.get(&#x27;COM&#x27;); // null psl.get(&#x27;example.COM&#x27;); // &#x27;example.com&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;WwW.example.COM&#x27;); // &#x27;example.com&#x27;
  </p>
  <p>
    // Unlisted TLD. psl.get(&#x27;example&#x27;); // null psl.get(&#x27;example.example&#x27;); // &#x27;example.example&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;b.example.example&#x27;); // &#x27;example.example&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;a.b.example.example&#x27;); // &#x27;example.example&#x27;
  </p>
  <p>
    // TLD with only 1 rule. psl.get(&#x27;biz&#x27;); // null psl.get(&#x27;domain.biz&#x27;); // &#x27;domain.biz&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;b.domain.biz&#x27;); // &#x27;domain.biz&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;a.b.domain.biz&#x27;); // &#x27;domain.biz&#x27;
  </p>
  <p>
    // TLD with some 2-level rules. psl.get(&#x27;uk.com&#x27;); // null); psl.get(&#x27;example.uk.com&#x27;); // &#x27;example.uk.com&#x27;); psl.get(&#x27;b.example.uk.com&#x27;); // &#x27;example.uk.com&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    // More complex TLD. psl.get(&#x27;c.kobe.jp&#x27;); // null psl.get(&#x27;b.c.kobe.jp&#x27;); // &#x27;b.c.kobe.jp&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;a.b.c.kobe.jp&#x27;); // &#x27;b.c.kobe.jp&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;city.kobe.jp&#x27;); // &#x27;city.kobe.jp&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;www.city.kobe.jp&#x27;); // &#x27;city.kobe.jp&#x27;
  </p>
  <p>
    // IDN labels. psl.get(&#x27;食狮.com.cn&#x27;); // &#x27;食狮.com.cn&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;食狮.公司.cn&#x27;); // &#x27;食狮.公司.cn&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;www.食狮.公司.cn&#x27;); // &#x27;食狮.公司.cn&#x27;
  </p>
  <p>
    // Same as above, but punycoded. psl.get(&#x27;xn--85x722f.com.cn&#x27;); // &#x27;xn--85x722f.com.cn&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn&#x27;); // &#x27;xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn&#x27; psl.get(&#x27;www.xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn&#x27;); // &#x27;xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn&#x27; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

  </p>
  <p>
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

  </p>
  <p>
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.

    # Slick 
  </p>
  <p>
    Slick is a standalone selector engine that is totally slick. Slick is split in 2 components: the Finder and the Parser. The Finder&#x27;s job is to find nodes on a webpage, the Parser&#x27;s job is to create a javascript object representation of any css selector. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Slick allows you to: 
  </p>
  <p>
     * Create your own custom pseudo-classes * Use the Parser by itself. * Find nodes in XML documents. 
  </p>
  <p>
     --- 
  </p>
  <p>
    ## The Finder 
  </p>
  <p>
    Find nodes in the DOM 
  </p>
  <p>
    ### &#x60;search&#x60; context for selector 
  </p>
  <p>
    Search this context for any nodes that match this selector. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Expects: * selector: String or SelectorObject * (**optional**) context: document or node or array of documents or nodes * (**optional**) append: Array or Object with a push method 
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns: append argument or Array of 0 or more nodes 
  </p>
  <p>
     slick.search(&quot;#foo &gt; bar.baz&quot;) → [&lt;bar&gt;, &lt;bar&gt;, &lt;bar&gt;] slick.search(&quot;li &gt; a&quot;, [&lt;ol&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;]) → [&lt;a&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;a&gt;] slick.search(&quot;#foo &gt; bar.baz&quot;, document, []) → [&lt;bar&gt;, &lt;bar&gt;, &lt;bar&gt;] 
  </p>
  <p>
    ### &#x60;find&#x60; first in context with selector or null 
  </p>
  <p>
    Find the first node in document that matches selector or null if none are found. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Expects: * selector: String or SelectorObject * (**optional**) context: document or node or array of documents or nodes 
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns: Element or null 
  </p>
  <p>
     slick.find(&quot;#foo &gt; bar.baz&quot;) → &lt;bar&gt; slick.find(&quot;#does-not-exist&quot;, node) → null 
  </p>
  <p>
    ### node &#x60;matches&#x60; selector? 
  </p>
  <p>
    Does this node match this selector? 
  </p>
  <p>
    Expects: * node * node, String or SelectorObject 
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns: true or false 
  </p>
  <p>
     slick.matches(&lt;div class&#x3D;rocks&gt;, &quot;div.rocks&quot;) → true slick.matches(&lt;div class&#x3D;lame&gt;, &quot;div.rocks&quot;) → false slick.matches(&lt;div class&#x3D;lame&gt;, &lt;div class&#x3D;rocks&gt;) → false 
  </p>
  <p>
    ### context &#x60;contains&#x60; node? 
  </p>
  <p>
    Does this context contain this node? Is the context a parent of this node? 
  </p>
  <p>
    Expects: * context: document or node * node: node 
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns: true or false 
  </p>
  <p>
     slick.contains(&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;) → true slick.contains(&lt;body&gt;, &lt;html&gt;) → false 
  </p>
  <p>
    --- 
  </p>
  <p>
    ## The Parser 
  </p>
  <p>
    Parse a CSS selector string into a JavaScript object 
  </p>
  <p>
    ### &#x60;parse&#x60; selector into object 
  </p>
  <p>
    Parse a CSS Selector String into a Selector Object. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Expects: String 
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns: SelectorObject 
  </p>
  <p>
     slick.parse(&quot;#foo &gt; bar.baz&quot;) → SelectorObject 
  </p>

    # Source Map
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a library to generate and consume the source map format [described here][format].
  </p>
  <p>
    This library is written in the Asynchronous Module Definition format, and works in the following environments:
  </p>
  <p>
    * Modern Browsers supporting ECMAScript 5 (either after the build, or with an AMD loader such as RequireJS)
  </p>
  <p>
    * Inside Firefox (as a JSM file, after the build)
  </p>
  <p>
    * With NodeJS versions 0.8.X and higher
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Node
  </p>
  <p>
     $ npm install source-map
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Building from Source (for everywhere else)
  </p>
  <p>
    Install Node and then run
  </p>
  <p>
     $ git clone https://fitzgen@github.com/mozilla/source-map.git $ cd source-map $ npm link .
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, run
  </p>
  <p>
     $ node Makefile.dryice.js
  </p>
  <p>
    This should spew a bunch of stuff to stdout, and create the following files:
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;dist/source-map.js&#x60; - The unminified browser version.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;dist/source-map.min.js&#x60; - The minified browser version.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;dist/SourceMap.jsm&#x60; - The JavaScript Module for inclusion in Firefox source.
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Examples
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Consuming a source map
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var rawSourceMap &#x3D; { version: 3, file: &#x27;min.js&#x27;, names: [&#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;baz&#x27;, &#x27;n&#x27;], sources: [&#x27;one.js&#x27;, &#x27;two.js&#x27;], sourceRoot: &#x27;http://example.com/www/js/&#x27;, mappings: &#x27;CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA&#x27; };
  </p>
  <p>
    var smc &#x3D; new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);
  </p>
  <p>
    console.log(smc.sources); // [ &#x27;http://example.com/www/js/one.js&#x27;, // &#x27;http://example.com/www/js/two.js&#x27; ]
  </p>
  <p>
    console.log(smc.originalPositionFor({ line: 2, column: 28 })); // { source: &#x27;http://example.com/www/js/two.js&#x27;, // line: 2, // column: 10, // name: &#x27;n&#x27; }
  </p>
  <p>
    console.log(smc.generatedPositionFor({ source: &#x27;http://example.com/www/js/two.js&#x27;, line: 2, column: 10 })); // { line: 2, column: 28 }
  </p>
  <p>
    smc.eachMapping(function (m) { // ... }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>

    ### Generating a source map
  </p>
  <p>
    In depth guide: [**Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source Maps**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/)
  </p>
  <p>
    #### With SourceNode (high level API)
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js function compile(ast) { switch (ast.type) { case &#x27;BinaryExpression&#x27;: return new SourceNode( ast.location.line, ast.location.column, ast.location.source, [compile(ast.left), &quot; + &quot;, compile(ast.right)] ); case &#x27;Literal&#x27;: return new SourceNode( ast.location.line, ast.location.column, ast.location.source, String(ast.value) ); // ... default: throw new Error(&quot;Bad AST&quot;); } }
  </p>
  <p>
    var ast &#x3D; parse(&quot;40 + 2&quot;, &quot;add.js&quot;); console.log(compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({ file: &#x27;add.js&#x27; })); // { code: &#x27;40 + 2&#x27;, // map: [object SourceMapGenerator] } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    #### With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var map &#x3D; new SourceMapGenerator({ file: &quot;source-mapped.js&quot; });
  </p>
  <p>
    map.addMapping({ generated: { line: 10, column: 35 }, source: &quot;foo.js&quot;, original: { line: 33, column: 2 }, name: &quot;christopher&quot; });
  </p>
  <p>
    console.log(map.toString()); // &#x27;{&quot;version&quot;:3,&quot;file&quot;:&quot;source-mapped.js&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;foo.js&quot;],&quot;names&quot;:[&quot;christopher&quot;],&quot;mappings&quot;:&quot;;;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA&quot;}&#x27; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ## API
  </p>
  <p>
    Get a reference to the module:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js // NodeJS var sourceMap &#x3D; require(&#x27;source-map&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    // Browser builds var sourceMap &#x3D; window.sourceMap;
  </p>
  <p>
    // Inside Firefox let sourceMap &#x3D; {}; Components.utils.import(&#x27;resource:///modules/devtools/SourceMap.jsm&#x27;, sourceMap); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### SourceMapConsumer
  </p>
  <p>
    A SourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can query for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position in the generated source.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)
  </p>
  <p>
    The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which can be &#x60;JSON.parse&#x60;&#x27;d, or an object). According to the spec, source maps have the following attributes:
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;version&#x60;: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sources&#x60;: An array of URLs to the original source files.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;names&#x60;: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual mappings.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sourceRoot&#x60;: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sourcesContent&#x60;: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;mappings&#x60;: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;file&#x60;: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()
  </p>
  <p>
    Compute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is inclusive.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns the original source, line, and column information for the generated source&#x27;s line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with the following properties:
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;line&#x60;: The line number in the generated source.

  <p>
    #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns all generated line and column information for the original source, line, and column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings corresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line that has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the given line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column that has any offsets.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    ### SourceMapGenerator
  </p>
  <p>
    An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being built incrementally.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])
  </p>
  <p>
    You may pass an object with the following properties:
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;file&#x60;: The filename of the generated source that this source map is associated with.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sourceRoot&#x60;: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;skipValidation&#x60;: Optional. When &#x60;true&#x60;, disables validation of mappings as they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when running tests, if possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)
  </p>
  <p>
    Creates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sourceMapConsumer&#x60; The SourceMap.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)
  </p>
  <p>
    Add a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated source&#x27;s line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object should have the following properties:
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;generated&#x60;: An object with the generated line and column positions.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;original&#x60;: An object with the original line and column positions.

  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;name&#x60;: An optional original token name for this mapping.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)
  </p>
  <p>
    Set the source content for an original source file.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sourceFile&#x60; the URL of the original source file.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sourceContent&#x60; the content of the source file.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])
  </p>
  <p>
    Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap. Each mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the supplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings is the minimium of this map and the supplied map.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sourceMapConsumer&#x60;: The SourceMap to be applied.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sourceFile&#x60;: Optional. The filename of the source file. If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists. Otherwise an error will be thrown.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sourceMapPath&#x60;: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.
  </p>
  <p>
     This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren&#x27;t in the same directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten relative to the SourceMap.
  </p>
  <p>
     If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory, thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying &#x60;&#x27;.&#x27;&#x60; has the same effect.)
  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()
  </p>
  <p>
    Renders the source map being generated to a string.
  </p>
  <p>
    ### SourceNode
  </p>
  <p>
    SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and column information associated between those snippets and the original source code. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might use before outputting the generated JS and source map.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;line&#x60;: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if it isn&#x27;t associated with an original line.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;column&#x60;: The original column number associated with this source node, or null if it isn&#x27;t associated with an original column.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
    Prepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;chunk&#x60;: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of &#x60;SourceNode&#x60;, or an array where each member is one of those things.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)
  </p>
  <p>
    Set the source content for a source file. This will be added to the &#x60;SourceMap&#x60; in the &#x60;sourcesContent&#x60; field.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sourceFile&#x60;: The filename of the source file
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sourceContent&#x60;: The content of the source file
  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)
  </p>
  <p>
    Walk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and the its original associated source&#x27;s line/column location.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;fn&#x60;: The traversal function.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)

  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)
  </p>
  <p>
    Like &#x60;Array.prototype.join&#x60; except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator between each of this source node&#x27;s children.
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;sep&#x60;: The separator.
  </p>
  <p>
    #### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)
  </p>
  <p>

    #### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])
  </p>
  <p>
    Returns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a SourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and original sources.

  </p>
  <p>
    ## Tests
  </p>
  <p>
    [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch&#x3D;master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)
  </p>
  <p>
    Install NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run &#x60;node test/run-tests.js&#x60;.
  </p>
  <p>
    To add new tests, create a new file named &#x60;test/test-&lt;your new test name&gt;.js&#x60; and export your test functions with names that start with &quot;test&quot;, for example
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js exports[&quot;test doing the foo bar&quot;] &#x3D; function (assert, util) { ... }; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    The new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.
  </p>
  <p>
    The &#x60;util&#x60; argument is the test utility module located at &#x60;test/source-map/util&#x60;.
  </p>
  <p>
    The &#x60;assert&#x60; argument is a cut down version of node&#x27;s assert module. You have access to the following assertion functions:
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;doesNotThrow&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;equal&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;ok&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;strictEqual&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    * &#x60;throws&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    (The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the tests to run inside Firefox&#x27;s test suite as well and so the assert module is shimmed in that environment. See &#x60;build/assert-shim.js&#x60;.)

  </p>
  <p>
    Module that provides setImmediate() functionality for the browser using postMessage events
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Installation
  </p>
  <p>
    Install it using [SPM](https://wiki.spotify.net/wiki/NPM#Alias):
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; $ spm install spotify-deferred &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Usage
  </p>
  <p>
    The API is a single function which takes one argument. The functionality is similar to the [setImmediate()](http://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#timers_setimmediate_callback_arg) function in Node.js
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var defer &#x3D; require(&#x27;spotify-deferred&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    defer(function() { console.log(&#x27;world&#x27;); });
  </p>
  <p>
    console.log(&#x27;hello&#x27;); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    When run in a non-browser environment (like Node.js) it will fallback to setImmediate()

    ## Version 3.0.0 Note
  </p>
  <p>
    Version 3.0.0 introduces breaking changes to the library, removing deprecated and unused methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following methods were removed from the &#x60;EventEmitter&#x60; class:
  </p>
  <p>
    - &#x60;addEvent&#x60; - &#x60;addEvents&#x60; - &#x60;addOnceEvent&#x60; - &#x60;removeEvent&#x60; - &#x60;removeEvents&#x60; - &#x60;fireEvent&#x60; - &#x60;fireEventSync&#x60; - &#x60;off&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    The following methods were removed from the &#x60;Event&#x60; object:
  </p>
  <p>
    - &#x60;isDefaultPrevented&#x60; - &#x60;isPropagationStopped&#x60; - &#x60;isImmediatePropagationStopped&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Usage
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Basic usage
  </p>
  <p>
    The &#x60;EventEmitter&#x60; class can be used to enable events in other class via inheritance:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var inherit &#x3D; require(&#x27;spotify-inheritance/inherit&#x27;); var EventEmitter &#x3D; require(&#x27;spotify-eventemitter&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    var MyObject &#x3D; function() { EventEmitter.call(this); } inherit(MyObject, EventEmitter); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    An object that inherits from &#x60;EventEmitter&#x60; gets access to &quot;events&quot;, and can take listeners and fire events:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var obj &#x3D; new MyObject();
  </p>
  <p>
    obj.on(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, function(event) { console.log(event.type); // &#x27;my_custom_event&#x27; console.log(&#x27;hello, &#x27; + event.name); });
  </p>
  <p>
    obj.emit(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, {name: &#x27;world&#x27;}); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Adding Handlers
  </p>
  <p>
    Objects inheriting from &#x60;EventEmitter&#x60; get access to the &#x60;on&#x60; method (or its alias, &#x60;addListener&#x60;), which can be used to attach event listeners:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var obj &#x3D; new MyObject();
  </p>
  <p>
    obj.on(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, function(event) { // Do something }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    The first argument to &#x60;on&#x60; is a string which is the event name, and the second argument is an event handler function. When an event is fired, the handler will be called with one argument, which will be an instance of the &#x60;Event&#x60; class.
  </p>
  <p>
    An &#x60;Event&#x60; object will have a few default properties and methods:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var obj &#x3D; new MyObject();
  </p>
  <p>
    obj.on(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, function(event) { event.type; // &#x27;my_custom_event&#x27; event.defaultPrevented; // true if &#x60;preventDefault&#x60; was called on the event, // false otherwise.
  </p>
  <p>
     event.preventDefault(); // Prevents the default behaviour of the event. event.stopImmediatePropagation(); // Stops the propagation of the event to // other event listeners. });
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to note that while &#x60;event.stopPropagation()&#x60; is handled internally by the library, &#x60;event.preventDefault()&#x60; needs to be implemented by the class itself, and therefore might not always prevent default behaviour.
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Execute an event handler only once
  </p>
  <p>
    You can register an event handler to be executed only once (after being executed it will be automatically unregistered):
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js obj.once(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, handlerFunction); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Remove event handlers
  </p>
  <p>
    You can remove an event handler or multiple event handlers. You should pass the same handler function that was used for registering the handler:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js // Remove one event handler obj.removeListener(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, originalHandler);
  </p>
  <p>
    // Remove all event handlers from an event type obj.removeAllListeners(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Emitting events
  </p>
  <p>
    You can emit events synchronously or asynchronously (in the next event loop): &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js // Emit asynchronously. obj.emit(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    // Emit synchronously. obj.emitSync(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    The second optional parameter to &#x60;emit&#x60; and &#x60;emitSync&#x60; is an object, whose properties will be added to the &#x60;Event&#x60; object that will be passed to the listeners.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js obj.emit(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, {count: 1, body: document.body});
  </p>
  <p>
    obj.on(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, function(event) { // event here is an instance of the &#x60;Event&#x60; class. event.count &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 1; event.body &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; document.body; }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Emitting Your Own Event Objects
  </p>
  <p>
    You can create your own &#x60;EventObjects&#x60; by using the static function &#x60;EventEmitter.createEvent&#x60;:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var event &#x3D; EventEmitter.createEvent(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, {data: 1}); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    You can emit these objects using the &#x60;emitEvent&#x60; and &#x60;emitEventSync&#x60; methods:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var event &#x3D; EventEmitter.createEvent(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, {data: 1}); myObject.emitEvent(event); myObject.emitEventSync(event); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Handling &#x60;preventDefault()&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    You can handle &quot;preventing default behaviour&quot; in two ways. The simplest one is by using &#x60;emitSync&#x60;, which returns the &#x60;Event&#x60; object that was created, or by creating your own event and using &#x60;emitEventSync&#x60;:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js function MyObject() { EventEmitter.call(this); } MyObject.prototype &#x3D; new EventEmitter;
  </p>
  <p>
    MyObject.prototype.doSomething &#x3D; function() { var event &#x3D; this.emitSync(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;); if (!event.defaultPrevented) { // Proceed as usual. } };
  </p>
  <p>
    var obj &#x3D; new MyObject();
  </p>
  <p>
    obj.on(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, function(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); });
  </p>
  <p>
    obj.doSomething();
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don&#x27;t want to fire the event synchronously, you can use the asynchronous methods &#x60;emitAndWait&#x60; and &#x60;emitEventAndWait&#x60;. Both of these methods work like &#x60;emit&#x60; and &#x60;emitEvent&#x60; respectively, but they can also take in a third argument, which is a function that will be called when all the event handlers have been called.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js function MyObject() { EventEmitter.call(this); } MyObject.prototype &#x3D; new EventEmitter;
  </p>
  <p>
    MyObject.prototype.doSomething &#x3D; function() { this.emitAndWait(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, null, function(event) { if (!event.defaultPrevented) { // Proceed as usual. } }); };
  </p>
  <p>
    var obj &#x3D; new MyObject();
  </p>
  <p>
    obj.on(&#x27;my_custom_event&#x27;, function(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); });
  </p>
  <p>
    obj.doSomething();
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Proxying Events
  </p>
  <p>
    When composing together objects that are instances of &#x60;EventEmitter&#x60;, there are cases where you&#x27;d want to redirect the event of an internal object. You can do this naively by using &#x60;on&#x60; and &#x60;emitEvent&#x60;.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js function First() { EventEmitter.call(this); } First.prototype &#x3D; new EventEmitter();
  </p>
  <p>
    First.prototype.doSomething &#x3D; function() { this.emit(&#x27;first_event&#x27;); };
  </p>
  <p>
    function Second() { EventEmitter.call(this);
  </p>
  <p>
     this._first &#x3D; new First();
  </p>
  <p>
     this._first.on(&#x27;first_event&#x27;, this.emitEvent.bind(this)); } Second.prototype &#x3D; new EventEmitter();
  </p>
  <p>
    Second.prototype.doSomething &#x3D; function() { return this._first.doSomething(); };
  </p>
  <p>
    var obj &#x3D; new Second(); obj.on(&#x27;first_event&#x27;, myCallback); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    While this works, there might be cases where you&#x27;d like to rename the event before you emit it. This would involve handling the event specifically and then retriggering the emit:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js function First() { EventEmitter.call(this); } First.prototype &#x3D; new EventEmitter();
  </p>
  <p>
    First.prototype.doSomething &#x3D; function() { this.emit(&#x27;first_event&#x27;); };
  </p>
  <p>
    function Second() { EventEmitter.call(this);
  </p>
  <p>
     this._first &#x3D; new First();
  </p>
  <p>
     this._first.on(&#x27;first_event&#x27;, function() { this.emit(&#x27;second_event&#x27;); }.bind(this)); } Second.prototype &#x3D; new EventEmitter();
  </p>
  <p>
    Second.prototype.doSomething &#x3D; function() { return this._first.doSomething(); };
  </p>
  <p>
    var obj &#x3D; new Second(); obj.on(&#x27;first_event&#x27;, myCallback); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    You can simplify this by using &#x60;proxyEmit&#x60; (and &#x60;proxyEmitSync&#x60;). This function allows you to define a mapping between an internal event to an external event you want to emit:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js function First() { EventEmitter.call(this); } First.prototype &#x3D; new EventEmitter();
  </p>
  <p>
    First.prototype.doSomething &#x3D; function() { this.emit(&#x27;first_event&#x27;); };
  </p>
  <p>
    function Second() { EventEmitter.call(this);
  </p>
  <p>
     this._first &#x3D; new First();
  </p>
  <p>
     this.proxyEmit(this._first, &#x27;first_event&#x27;, &#x27;second_event&#x27;); } Second.prototype &#x3D; new EventEmitter();
  </p>
  <p>
    Second.prototype.doSomething &#x3D; function() { return this._first.doSomething(); };
  </p>
  <p>
    var obj &#x3D; new Second(); obj.on(&#x27;first_event&#x27;, myCallback); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Meta-Listeners
  </p>
  <p>
    You can attach &quot;meta-listeners&quot; to &#x60;EventEmitter&#x60; instances, which are listeners for two kinds of meta events: listener addition and listener removal.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js function MyEmitter() { EventEmitter.call(this);
  </p>
  <p>
     this.onAddListener( &#x27;custom_event&#x27;, this._onAddCustomEventListener.bind(this) ); this.onRemoveListener( &#x27;custom_event&#x27;, this._onRemoveCustomEventListener.bind(this) ); } MyEmitter.prototype &#x3D; new EventEmitter();
  </p>
  <p>
    MyEmitter.prototype._onAddCustomEventListener &#x3D; function(event) { event.type; // &#x27;add:custom_event&#x27; event.listener; // The listener function that was added. };
  </p>
  <p>
    MyEmitter.prototype._onRemoveCustomEventListener &#x3D; function(event) { event.type; // &#x27;remove:custom_event&#x27; event.listener; // The listener function that was added. };
  </p>
  <p>
    MyEmitter.prototype.doSomething &#x3D; function() { this.emit(&#x27;custom_event&#x27;); }; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Meta-listeners are implemented as normal event listeners, and therefore they have access to &#x60;preventDefault()&#x60;. When you call &#x60;preventDefault&#x60; on an &quot;add meta-listener&quot;, it will prevent the listener from being added to your object; if you call it on a &quot;remove meta-listener&quot;, it will prevent the listener from being removed.

    # spotify-liburi
  </p>
  <p>
    A library for creating, parsing and transforming Spotify URIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Installation
  </p>
  <p>
    Install it using [SPM](https://wiki.spotify.net/wiki/NPM#Alias):
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh $ spm install spotify-liburi &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Basic Usage
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var URI &#x3D; require(&#x27;spotify-liburi&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    // Parse a URI: var uri &#x3D; URI.from(&#x27;spotify:track:2aeVGqdsF7WbKZkwhcCeqm&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    uri.type &#x3D;&#x3D; URI.Type.TRACK; // true;
  </p>
  <p>
    // Turn it into a URI string: uri.toURI(); // &#x27;spotify:track:2aeVGqdsF7WbKZkwhcCeqm&#x27;
  </p>
  <p>
    // Transform it into a Play URL string: uri.toPlayURL(); // &#x27;http://play.spotify.com/track/2aeVGqdsF7WbKZkwhcCeqm&#x27; uri.toSecurePlayURL(); // &#x27;https://play.spotify.com/track/2aeVGqdsF7WbKZkwhcCeqm&#x27;
  </p>
  <p>
    // Transform it into a Open URL string: uri.toOpenURL(); // &#x27;http://open.spotify.com/track/2aeVGqdsF7WbKZkwhcCeqm&#x27; uri.toSecureOpenURL(); // &#x27;https://open.spotify.com/track/2aeVGqdsF7WbKZkwhcCeqm&#x27;
  </p>
  <p>
    // Transform it into an app URI: var appURI &#x3D; uri.toAppType(); appURI.toURI(); // &#x27;spotify:app:track:2aeVGqdsF7WbKZkwhcCeqm&#x27; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ## Important Notes
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Based62 IDs
  </p>
  <p>
    Metadata identifiers are serialized in URI and URL strings as base62-encoded strings. Services, however, use the hex-encoded version of these base62 string ids. The URI class reflects this by transforming any base62 encoded id as hex for the following types:
  </p>
  <p>
    - album - artist - artist-toplist - collectiontracklist - image - playlist - track
  </p>
  <p>
    This might lead to suprising behaviour:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var uri &#x3D; URI.from(&#x27;spotify:track:2aeVGqdsF7WbKZkwhcCeqm&#x27;); // id is base62
  </p>
  <p>
    uri.id; // &#x27;47240cf4ca3e4f83acfb70335cc5470a&#x27; - id is hex &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    The library exposes two functions to help when dealing with IDs: &#x60;URI.idToHex(id)&#x60; and &#x60;URI.hexToId(hex)&#x60;:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var uri &#x3D; URI.from(&#x27;spotify:track:2aeVGqdsF7WbKZkwhcCeqm&#x27;);
  </p>
  <p>
    var base62 &#x3D; URI.hexToId(uri.id); // &#x27;2aeVGqdsF7WbKZkwhcCeqm&#x27; var hex &#x3D; URI.idToHex(base62); // &#x27;47240cf4ca3e4f83acfb70335cc5470a&#x27; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    ### Usernames
  </p>
  <p>
    Usernames are always serialized in URI and URL strings as URL-encoded strings. This is called the &quot;canonical&quot; representation of the username, and is used by services when resolving users.
  </p>
  <p>
    When parsing the usernames, however, the URI class will decode the canonical username into its &quot;display&quot; (i.e., non-canonical) representation.
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var uri &#x3D; URI.from(&#x27;spotify:user:%E2%98%83&#x27;); // canonical username is &#x27;%E2%98%83&#x27;
  </p>
  <p>
    uri.username; // &#x27;☃&#x27; (Unicode snowman) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    The library exposes two functions to help with dealing with usernames: &#x60;URI.getCanonicalUsername(username)&#x60; and &#x60;URI.getDisplayUsername(username)&#x60;:
  </p>
  <p>
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var uri &#x3D; URI.from(&#x27;spotify:user:%E2%98%83&#x27;); 
  </p>
  <p>
    var canonical &#x3D; URI.getCanonicalUsername(uri.username); // &#x27;%E2%98%83&#x27; var display &#x3D; URI.getDisplayUsername(canonical); &#x27;☃&#x27; (Unicode snowman) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>

  <h2><a name="spotify-modal@1.1.0" id="spotify-modal@1.1.0" href="#spotify-modal@1.1.0">spotify-modal@1.1.0</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href=""></a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Spotify Modal &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;
  </p>
  <p>
    Use like this: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js var modal &#x3D; new Modal(); modal.getContainer().innerHTML &#x3D; &#x27;&lt;div&gt;Fancy modal in here&lt;/div&gt;&#x27;; modal.show(); // Show the modal modal.hide(); // Yeah, hide it &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Internally, it creates two elements and appends them to the body: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;HTML &lt;div class&#x3D;&quot;modal-backdrop&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class&#x3D;&quot;popover modal modal-generic no-scroll&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that this module depends on styles from GLUE, specifically the popover modal code: https://ghe.spotify.net/design/glue/blob/master/less/popovers.less
  </p>
  <p>
    The modal is hidden when you click the backdrop or click escape (or call &#x60;.hide()&#x60;).

  <p>
     &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof. 
  </p>
  <p>
     &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

  </p>
  <p>
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 
  </p>
  <p>
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

  <p>
     (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. 
  </p>
  <p>
     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. 
  </p>
  <p>
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

  </p>
  <p>
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 
  </p>
  <p>
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
  </p>
  <p>
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  </p>
  <p>
    &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  </p>

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
  </p>
  <p>
    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  </p>
  <p>
    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
  </p>
  <p>
    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
  </p>
  <p>
    If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  </p>
  <p>
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  </p>
  <p>
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  </p>
  <p>
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  </p>
  <p>
    &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

  </p>
  <p>
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
  </p>
  <p>
    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  </p>
  <p>
    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
  </p>
  <p>
    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
  </p>
  <p>
    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  </p>
  <p>
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  </p>
  <p>
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  </p>
  <p>
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
  </p>
  <p>
    The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
  </p>
  <p>
